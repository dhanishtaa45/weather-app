## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to:

- ✅ Learn how to interact with public APIs
- ✅ Practice using JavaScript's `fetch()` method for asynchronous data handling
- ✅ Apply client-side DOM manipulation to display weather data dynamically
- ✅ Design a responsive and clean user interface using basic HTML and CSS
